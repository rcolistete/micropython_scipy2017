# MicroPython sprint at SciPy 2017
Austin-TX, July 15-16th 2017

The MicroPython sprint goal is to live demonstrate MicroPython to new users and attract new developers to contribute to scientific MicroPython modules, for example, by porting/adapting scientific Python 3 modules.  

### Goals :

This sprint is the first opportunity in SciPy history to practice :
- MicroPython on real microcontroller boards;
- connecting to sensors and actuators;
- processing sensor data with scientific MicroPython modules (statistics, error propagation, FFT, etc);
- IoT (Internet of Things) using WiFi and/or LoRa to publish sensor data;
- creating new MicroPython modules, from scratch or converting/adapting from scientific Python 3 modules;
- contributing to the MicroPython community.

### To know more about MicroPython

First look at the [**"Scientific MicroPython on Microcontrollers and IoT" talk**](http://www.robertocolistete.net/MicroPythonSciPy2017/#/) given on July 13th 2017, where MicroPython is presented and all official MicroPython boards are cited.

### Using real MicroPython boards on MicroPython sprint

What is need to use MicroPython boards ? Bring your computer and (if possible) a USB-microUSB cable (many will be available in the MicroPython sprint). On your computer, [install a terminal software (Putty, screen, etc) to connect to the MicroPython board using the USB-microUSB cable](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/pyboard/tutorial/repl.html). 

The MicroPython sprint has the following microcontroller boards available :
* 3 Pyboards
* 1 WiPy 1 (WiFi), 1 WiPy 2 (WiFi, Bluetooth)
* 2 LoPy (LoRa, WiFi, Bluetooth);
* 11 ESP8266/WeMos D1 Mini (WiFi)
* 2 BBC Micro:bit (Bluetooth)
* 1 OpenMV CAM M7
* 1 Teensy 3.5 (community port of MicroPython).
As well many sensors like BME280, etc.
