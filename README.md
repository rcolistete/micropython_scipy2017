What is need to use MicroPython boards ? Bring your computer and (if possible) a USB-microUSB cable (many will be available in the MicroPython sprint). On your computer, [install a terminal software (Putty, screen, etc) to connect to the MicroPython board using the USB-microUSB cable](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/pyboard/tutorial/repl.html).
